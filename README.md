# Bitq-Engine
A simple engine i made in C# as a learning experience, this "engine" is nothing cool but i made it in a week out of spite to show how bad coppercube is and to remake one of my friend's brother's game called [spongehurgle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfpRXGDwTMM), the engine is pretty limited but you can do stuff in it.
