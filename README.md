# Bitq-Engine
A simple engine i made in C# as a learning experience, this "engine" (it's more like a level editor in its current state) is nothing cool but i made it in a week out of spite to show how bad coppercube is and to remake one of my friend's brother's game called [spongehurgle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfpRXGDwTMM), the engine is pretty limited but you can do stuff in it.

I used luau for the scripting via my own bindings, silk.net for renderering via glfw and opengl and for audio via openal and i'm using the bullet physics engine. it uses a similar structure to unity with it being gameobject and components.

I don't think im gonna revisit this project but it is definitely cool in my opinion.
